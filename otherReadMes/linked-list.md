# Linked List
## The Challenge
Create a Node class that contains data and a pointer to the next Node. Create a Linked List class, an empty linked list
should be created upon instantiation.

## Approach & Efficiency

## API
Method | Description
------ | -----
.insert(int value) | Takes in an integer value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the
list.
.includes(int value) | Takes in an integer value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on the value
exists
as a
Node's value somewhere within the list.
.print() | Does not accept arguments and will output all the current Node Values in the linked list.
