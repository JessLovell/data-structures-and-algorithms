# Radix Sort
## The Challenge
Implement Radix Sort

## Approach & Efficiency
My approach was to get the number of digits, `k`, and loop through the input array `k` times. Each time putting a value into a `List` with the comparable value. Then pulling the values out of that list and storing them in the original array. Once the loop is complete, I return the result array.

Method | Description | Time | Space
`.radixSort(int[] array)` | This method returns an array with the values sorted in ascending order. | `O(n)` | `O(n)`
