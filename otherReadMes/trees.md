# Trees
[Code](../src/main/java/Tree) | [Tests](../src/test/java/Tree)

## The Challenge
1. Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node .
2. Create a BinaryTree class.
    1. Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which takes in a root node, and returns an array of the nodes.
3. Create a BinarySearchTree class.
    1. Define a method named add that adds a new node in the correct location in the binary search tree.
    2. Define a method named search that brings in a value of node, and returns the node with the desired value.
4. Write **three** test assertions for each method.
5. **Stretch Goals:** Write a class for a `k-ary` tree. Use resources available to you online, implement a k-ary tree, where each node can have any number of children.
