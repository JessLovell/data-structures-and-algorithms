# Trees

## The Challenge
1. Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument.
2. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine weather or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both, and change the value of each of the nodes:
    - If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
    - If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
    - If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”

## Approach & Efficiency
My approach was to traverse the tree recursively, and change each node according to the challenge rules.
