# Intersecting Binary Trees
## The Challenge
Find common values in 2 binary trees.

## Approach & Efficiency
My approach was to create a `HashSet` for each `Binary Tree` and the intersection of the two trees. I would then loop through the first set of `Nodes` checking against the second set of nodes. If it is in both sets, I would then add the node to the `Intersection` set.
